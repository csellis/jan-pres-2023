						# Business Case for SvelteKit
						by Chris Ellis
						---
						## Hey, I'm Chris
						- I'm Sr Director of Engineering at [XtendOps](https://www.xtendops.com)
						---
						## Who we are
						- We're a Business Processes Outsourcing company
						- We help companies with Customer Experience
						- Engineering at XtendOps supports our Customer Experience and Clients
						---
						## Our Tech Stack
						- We're a JavaScript shop
						- We use Svelte, Meteor, and MongoDB
						---
						## What we started with
						- Serverful Meteor/Svelte apps
						- Evolutionary product development
						- Meteor App has batteries included
						- Handled authentication, devops, routing, etc.
						---
						![Meteor](meteor.png)
						---
						## What's the problem?
						- I still love Meteor
						- But...
							- Our builds are slow
							- Smaller ecosystem
							- Apps feel heavy
						---
						# Dilemma
						---
						## Kicking Tyres(Tires @ ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸)
						- Feasibility check
						- My role at XtendOps
						---
						## Kicking Tyres(Tires @ ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸)
						Can we:
						- rebuild Meteor modelled authentication?
						- build our most complicated assessments?
						- handle transitions between Flows?
						- wrestle our "evolved" data model?
						---
						## Authentication
						- We use Meteor's accounts system
						- Great thing about Open Source
						- Loved the simplicity
						- Modelled off of it
						---
						## Voice Assessments
						- Records user's voice & transcribes in GCS
						- Scores transcription to estimate BPO level of English
						- Would this hold up in SvelteKit Endpoints?
						---
						## Flows
						- Our assessments are built in Flows
						- A Flow is a series of steps specific to a Job, Client, or Office Base
						- Handled with SPA like routing
						---
						## Data Model
						- How do you start forcing schema on an API that has evolved with few constraints?
						- How do you handle the data model in a way that is flexible, but still enforceable?
						---
						## Data Model
						Prisma saves the day
						```
						npx prisma db pull
						```
						- 1200 line schema...Yikes
						- Does it build? Can I use it?
						---
						# Executing the Plan
						---
						## The Team
						- Team of wonderful full stack developers
						- Already fluent in Svelte, just needed to understand SvelteKit
						---
						## Split it up
						- Don't step on each other's toes
						- Use Prisma Client where it makes sense, default Case
						- Use Mongo Client where it doesn't
						---
						## Integration
						- As sections are completed, integrate them into the whole
						- Flows made this complicated
						- Use SvelteKit Endpoints to handle API calls
						---
						## Testing
						- We did E2E testing in PlayWright
						- There was a lot of manual testing though
						- UI/UX played a huge role in this
						---
						# Results
						---
						## Dev Experience ðŸ¤©
						- SvelteKit is a joy to work with
						- SvelteKit Endpoints are a great way to handle API calls
						- Prisma Client is an amazing way to handle data
						- How long do you think it took to build this?
						---
						# 2.2 weeks
